This app will demonstrate how you could make use of styles, widgets, events and jquery within kanso (http://kansojs.org).

In short: Give Kanso-CRUD some colors, more action and a nicer GUI.

It is based on the minimalistic CRUD App that shows how operations on CouchDB are made with the Kanso Framework.
You can find it on https://github.com/descartes1/Kanso-CRUD

/* Short guide to make things running */

0. Things you have should done before:
- Installed CouchDB
- Installed Kanso

1. Go to https://github.com/descartes1/Kanso-CRUD-GUI

2. Download the source to your PC

3. Extract the archive you downloaded before

4. You now should see a folder thats named something like "descartes1-Kanso-CRUD-GUI-XYZ123"

5. Rename the folder to Kanso-CRUD-GUI

Your folder structure should now looks like

Kanso-CRUD-GUI (folder)
|
|-lib (folder)
|-static (folder)
|-templates (folder)
|-kanso.json (file)
|-README (file)

6. Open a shell/termial

7. "cd" into the Kanso-CRUD-GUI folder, eg. "cd ./Kanso-CRUD-GUI"

8. Execute " kanso autopush http://yourdbuser:yourdbpass@localhost:5984/kcgui ".

Make sure, that your user has admin rights.
If you don't have a databaseuser yet, you're probably in "Admin Party"-mode. 
See http://kansojs.org/guides/getting_started.html#users_and_permissions how to fix this.

If there is no database named kcgui in couchdb, it will be generated for you by kanso.

9. Go to http://localhost:5984/kcgui/_design/kcgui/_rewrite/ and enjoy.
